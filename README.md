# Premier-League-Match-Predictor

Premier Match Fixture Predictor based on Recent Form. 
Recent Form is determined by wins, losses, points gained, and goal difference over the last five matches. *For now, will add more variables like xg, prevented xg, historical value...etc*
Features 2 Python files. Version one is the original (unfinished right now) code for the match predictor using an abundance of if/elif statements and hard-coding to produce a simple output. Version Two focuses on the Use of Machine Learning in order to produce the same output prediction in a more efficient, thorough, and complex way. Goal was to learn more about the implementation of Machine Learning in my programs to better my skills and provide an overall better way to predict match outcomes.

Uses ISportsAPI for the dataset.
